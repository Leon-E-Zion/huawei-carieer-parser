# Huawei-Cloud-Car
### Something written in the front section
There are three main reasons to upload the relevant code and models related to the update this time:
### A: 
want to leave some code; It is convenient for me to have something to rely on in the later Huawei competition, because ModelArts does have many unsatisfactory places temporarily. So keep a small code repository to record the relevant code improvements, tips and achievements that were used in the contest
### B: 
Want to leave some code behind; In previous competitions, unlike this one, the organizers paid less attention to the in-depth understanding of the official framework, but this year they paid more attention to the players' ability in this aspect. As a result, there were many detours on the road to producing code that met the official submission; The code is stored here for the future 215Family teachers and other interested young people to avoid detours and save time to carry out the development of ARTIFICIAL intelligence projects more efficiently.
### C:
The task arranged by Ms. Lei
